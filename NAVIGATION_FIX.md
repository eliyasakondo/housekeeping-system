# Navigation & Home Route Fix

## Issue Identified

When users logged in, they were redirected to `/home` which only showed a basic "You are logged in" message instead of their actual dashboard. Additionally, the logo in the sidebar didn't navigate to the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. HomeController Updated
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`

Changed the `index()` method to redirect users to their role-based dashboard:

```php
public function index()
{
    $user = auth()->user();
    
    if ($user->isAdmin()) {
        return redirect()->route('admin.dashboard');
    } elseif ($user->isOwner()) {
        return redirect()->route('owner.dashboard');
    } elseif ($user->isHousekeeper()) {
        return redirect()->route('housekeeper.dashboard');
    }
    
    // Fallback (shouldn't happen)
    return redirect('/login');
}
```

### 2. Sidebar Logo Link Updated
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

Changed the logo link from `url('/')` to `route('home')`:

```blade
<div class="sidebar-logo">
    <a href="{{ route('home') }}">
        <i class="bi bi-house-check-fill"></i>
        <span>Housekeeping</span>
    </a>
</div>
```

### 3. Mobile Top Bar Logo Made Clickable
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

Made the mobile top bar logo clickable and link to the dashboard:

```blade
<a href="{{ route('home') }}" class="top-bar-logo" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">
    <i class="bi bi-house-check-fill"></i> Housekeeping
</a>
```

## Result

Now when users:
1. **Log in** → They are redirected to `/home` which automatically takes them to their role-based dashboard
2. **Click the logo** (sidebar on desktop) → Navigate to their dashboard
3. **Click the app name** (mobile top bar) → Navigate to their dashboard

### Navigation Flow:

- **Admin** → `/admin/dashboard` (Dashboard with users, tasks, rooms, calendar)
- **Owner** → `/owner/dashboard` (Dashboard with properties, housekeepers, tasks)
- **Housekeeper** → `/housekeeper/dashboard` (Dashboard with checklists and schedule)

## Testing

Test by:
1. Login with any role
2. Notice you're on the correct dashboard (not just "You are logged in")
3. Click the logo in sidebar → should stay on/return to dashboard
4. Resize to mobile view → click app name in top bar → should return to dashboard

## Benefits

- ✅ Better user experience (land on actual dashboard, not generic page)
- ✅ Logo serves as "home" button to return to dashboard
- ✅ Consistent behavior across desktop and mobile
- ✅ Role-aware navigation (each user sees their appropriate dashboard)

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested
