## 🧪 Test #1: GPS Strict Enforcement

### Setup:
1. Login as property owner
2. Create a test property with GPS coordinates:
   - Latitude: 25.7617
   - Longitude: -80.1918
3. Create a housekeeper assignment for today

### Test Case A: Near Property (Should ALLOW)
1. Login as housekeeper
2. Go to checklist for the property
3. Click "Start Checklist"
4. When prompted for location, use:
   - Latitude: 25.7617 (same as property)
   - Longitude: -80.1918 (same as property)
5. **Expected Result:** ✅ Checklist starts successfully
6. **Error if fails:** GPS blocking too strict

### Test Case B: Far from Property (Should BLOCK)
1. Login as housekeeper
2. Go to checklist for the property
3. Click "Start Checklist"
4. When prompted for location, use:
   - Latitude: 25.8617 (0.1 degree away)
   - Longitude: -80.1918
5. **Expected Result:** ❌ Error message: "You must be at the property location..."
6. **Success:** Checklist does NOT start
7. **Error if fails:** GPS enforcement not working

### Test Case C: No Property GPS (Should ALLOW)
1. Create property without GPS coordinates (null)
2. Try to start checklist
3. **Expected Result:** ✅ Checklist starts (backward compatibility)

5. Open one of the uploaded photos
6. **Expected Result:** ✅ Timestamp visible on image
   - Black semi-transparent background
   - White text with date/time
   - Top-left corner
7. **Error if fails:** Check GD installation or image processing errors

### Test Case B: Without GD
1. Ensure GD is NOT enabled
2. Upload photos

## 📊 Data Verification

### Check Database After Completion:

```sql
-- Check checklist record
SELECT id, property_id, user_id, status, 
       started_at, completed_at,
       gps_latitude, gps_longitude, gps_verified,
       workflow_step
FROM checklists 
WHERE id = [CHECKLIST_ID];

-- Expected:
-- ✅ gps_verified = 1 (true)
-- ✅ workflow_step = 'photos' or NULL
-- ✅ started_at and completed_at filled
-- ✅ GPS coordinates present

-- Check checklist items
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tasks, 
       SUM(is_completed) as completed_tasks
FROM checklist_items 
WHERE checklist_id = [CHECKLIST_ID];

-- Expected:
-- ✅ total_tasks > 0
-- ✅ completed_tasks = total_tasks

-- Check inventory items
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_inventory,
       SUM(is_completed) as completed_inventory
FROM inventory_items 
WHERE checklist_id = [CHECKLIST_ID];

-- Expected:
-- ✅ total_inventory = 12
-- ✅ completed_inventory = 12

-- Check photos
SELECT room_id, COUNT(*) as photo_count,
       MIN(taken_at) as first_photo,
       MAX(taken_at) as last_photo
FROM photos 
WHERE checklist_id = [CHECKLIST_ID]
GROUP BY room_id;

-- Expected:
-- ✅ photo_count >= 8 per room
-- ✅ taken_at timestamps present
-- ✅ gps coordinates if provided
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: GPS Always Blocks
**Cause:** Property has no GPS coordinates  
**Solution:** Add GPS to property settings

### Issue 2: GPS Never Blocks
**Cause:** Code not updated  
**Solution:** Refresh browser, clear cache

### Issue 3: Photos Fail to Upload
**Cause:** Permission issues  
**Solution:** Check `storage/app/public/photos` permissions

### Issue 4: No Timestamp Overlay
**Cause:** GD not enabled  
**Solution:** Enable GD in php.ini and restart Apache

### Issue 5: Timestamp Overlay Error
**Cause:** Intervention Image issue  
**Solution:** Check logs, will fall back to no overlay automatically
