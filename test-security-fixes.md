# Security Fixes Testing Guide

## Test 1: Rate Limiting (Brute Force Protection)

### Steps:
1. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login
2. Try to login with **WRONG** password 5 times in a row:
   - Email: any existing user email
   - Password: wrongpassword123
3. On the 6th attempt, you should see:
   - ‚ùå **Error**: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in X seconds."
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait 60 seconds
4. After waiting, try correct password:
   - ‚úÖ Should work normally

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ First 5 attempts: "Invalid credentials" or similar
- ‚úÖ 6th attempt: "Too many login attempts" 
- ‚úÖ After 1 minute: Login works again

## Test 2: Browser Back Button After Logout (CRITICAL FIX)

### Steps:
1. Login to your account (any role: owner/admin/housekeeper)
2. Navigate to dashboard or any internal page
3. Click the **Logout** button
4. You should be redirected to login page
5. Press browser **BACK button** (‚Üê) or use keyboard: Alt + ‚Üê

### Expected Results:

**BEFORE FIX (Vulnerable):**
- ‚ùå Shows cached dashboard/internal pages
- ‚ùå Can see sensitive data
- ‚ùå Major security issue

**AFTER FIX (Secure):**
- ‚úÖ Redirects to login page immediately
- ‚úÖ Does NOT show cached pages
- ‚úÖ Shows message: "You have been logged out successfully"
- ‚úÖ Cannot access any authenticated pages

## Test 3: Verify Cache Headers (Technical)

### Steps:
1. Login to any account
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Navigate to any page (e.g., dashboard)
5. Click on the page request
6. Go to **Headers** tab
7. Look for Response Headers

### Expected Headers:
```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT
```

‚úÖ These headers prevent browser from caching pages

## Test 4: Session Destruction on Logout

### Steps:
1. Login to any account
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to **Application** tab ‚Üí **Cookies**
4. Note the session cookie values
5. Click Logout
6. Check cookies again

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Session cookie should be removed or changed
- ‚úÖ CSRF token should be regenerated
- ‚úÖ All session data cleared
