# Photo Upload Issue - GD Extension Missing (Oct 19, 2025)

## Critical Issue Discovered

**Problem**: Newly uploaded photos save to database but files don't actually get stored, so they don't display.

**Root Cause**: PHP GD extension is NOT installed/enabled, causing Intervention Image processing to fail silently.

## Investigation Results

```powershell
# Check GD availability
php -r "echo extension_loaded('gd') ? 'OK' : 'NOT FOUND';"
# Result: NOT FOUND ❌

# Check if files exist
Test-Path "storage/app/public/photos/3/*.png"
# Result: False (files not saved) ❌
```

## Solution Applied

### Temporary Fix: Disable Image Processing

Changed from complex image processing to simple file storage:

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Housekeeper/ChecklistController.php`

```php
// REMOVED: Image processing with timestamp overlay (requires GD)
try {
    $manager = new ImageManager(new Driver());
    $image = $manager->read($file);
    $image->text($timestamp...);
    $image->save(...);
} catch {}

// ADDED: Direct file storage (works without GD)
$storedPath = $file->storeAs('public/' . $path, $filename);

if (!$storedPath) {
    \Log::error('Failed to store photo');
    continue;
}
```

## How to Enable Timestamp Feature

### Step 1: Enable GD Extension

**Windows/XAMPP**:
1. Open `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`
2. Find: `;extension=gd`
3. Change to: `extension=gd`
4. Restart Apache
5. Verify: `php -i | findstr gd`

**Linux**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install php8.2-gd
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Verify
php -m | grep gd
```

### Step 2: Restore Image Processing Code

Once GD is enabled, update the upload method to add timestamps back.

## Current Status

- ✅ **Photos upload successfully** (without timestamp overlay)
- ✅ **Files saved to storage**
- ✅ **Photos display correctly**
- ⏭️ **Timestamp overlay** (requires GD extension)

## Testing

1. Login as housekeeper
2. Open checklist in photos step  
3. Upload photos
4. Verify they appear immediately
5. Check storage: `storage/app/public/photos/{checklist_id}/`

## Why Seeded Photos Work But Uploaded Don't

**Seeded photos**: Created manually with proper file_path, files exist
**Uploaded photos**: Database record created, but file storage failed due to GD missing

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Photos now work (timestamp feature pending GD installation)
