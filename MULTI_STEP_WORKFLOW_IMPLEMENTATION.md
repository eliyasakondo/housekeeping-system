# Multi-Step Workflow Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Requirement:** 100% compliance with customer requirements section 3

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented the 3-step sequential workflow as specified in the requirements:
1. **Step 1:** Room-by-room task checklist (enforced progression)
2. **Step 2:** Inventory checklist (unlocked after all rooms)
3. **Step 3:** Photo uploads (unlocked after inventory)

---

## Database Changes

### Migration 1: `add_workflow_tracking_to_checklists_table.php`

Added fields to `checklists` table:
```sql
- workflow_step (string, default 'tasks') - Tracks current step: tasks|inventory|photos
- current_room_id (foreign key to rooms) - Tracks which room is being worked on
- tasks_completed_at (timestamp) - When all room tasks were completed
- inventory_completed_at (timestamp) - When inventory was completed
```

### Migration 2: `create_inventory_items_table.php`

New table for inventory checklist:
```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory_items (
    id - Primary key
    checklist_id - Foreign key to checklists
    item_name - Name of inventory item (Towels, Sheets, etc.)
    quantity - Count of items
    is_available - Boolean (Available/Not Available)
    notes - Optional notes
    is_completed - Boolean tracking completion
    completed_at - Timestamp
    timestamps
)
```

---

## New Models

### `InventoryItem.php`
- Fillable: checklist_id, item_name, quantity, is_available, notes, is_completed, completed_at
- Relationship: belongsTo Checklist
- Casts: is_available, is_completed as boolean; completed_at as datetime

### Updated `Checklist.php`
- Added fillable: workflow_step, current_room_id, tasks_completed_at, inventory_completed_at
- New relationships: inventoryItems(), currentRoom()
- Tracks all three workflow steps

---

## Controller Changes

### `ChecklistController.php` - Major Updates

#### Modified Methods:

**start()** - Now initializes workflow:
- Sets workflow_step to 'tasks'
- Sets current_room_id to first room
- Creates all checklist items
- Creates inventory items (12 common Airbnb items)

**uploadPhoto()** - Now enforces step 3:
- Only allows uploads when workflow_step === 'photos'
- Returns 403 error if attempted in other steps

#### New Methods:

**completeRoom($checklist, Request)**
- Validates all tasks in current room are completed
- Moves to next room OR advances to inventory step
- Provides feedback on progress

**completeInventory($checklist, Request)**
- Validates all inventory items are checked
- Advances workflow_step to 'photos'
- Sets inventory_completed_at timestamp

**completeInventoryItem($checklist, $itemId, Request)**
- Updates inventory item: quantity, is_available, notes
- Marks item as completed
- Validates input (quantity ≥ 0, boolean availability)

**createInventoryItems($checklist)** - Private helper
- Creates 12 standard inventory items:
  - Towels, Bed Sheets, Pillowcases
  - Toilet Paper, Paper Towels
  - Hand Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner
  - Dish Soap, Trash Bags
  - Coffee/Tea, Kitchen Utensils

## Routes Added

```php
// Room completion
Route::post('/checklist/{checklist}/room/complete', [ChecklistController::class, 'completeRoom'])
    ->name('checklist.room.complete');

// Inventory completion
Route::post('/checklist/{checklist}/inventory/{item}/complete', [ChecklistController::class, 'completeInventoryItem'])
    ->name('checklist.inventory.item.complete');

Route::post('/checklist/{checklist}/inventory/complete', [ChecklistController::class, 'completeInventory'])
    ->name('checklist.inventory.complete');
```

## Workflow Progression Logic

### Step 1 → Step 2 Transition:
```php
// In completeRoom() when last room is completed:
$checklist->update([
    'current_room_id' => null,
    'workflow_step' => 'inventory',
    'tasks_completed_at' => now(),
]);
```

### Step 2 → Step 3 Transition:
```php
// In completeInventory():
$checklist->update([
    'workflow_step' => 'photos',
    'inventory_completed_at' => now(),
]);
```

### Step 3 → Completion:
```php
// In complete() - existing method:
$checklist->update([
    'status' => 'completed',
    'completed_at' => now(),
]);
```

---

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 3: "Tasks must be checked off room-by-room before proceeding to the next room"
**Implementation:**
- Only shows current room
- "Complete Room" button disabled until all tasks done
- Cannot manually navigate to other rooms
- Enforced at UI level (disabled buttons) and controller level (validation)

### ✅ Requirement 6: "Checklist room by room will show first, then once committed, Inventory checklist will show then"
**Implementation:**
- Workflow starts at 'tasks' step
- Shows one room at a time with "Complete Room & Continue" button
- After last room completed, automatically transitions to 'inventory' step
- Inventory step shows 12 items requiring verification
- Cannot skip or go backwards

### ✅ Requirement 7: "Photo upload will show last after housekeeper has committed that the first two checklist are complete"
**Implementation:**
- Photos hidden until workflow_step === 'photos'
- Upload button only works in photos step (403 error otherwise)
- Photos step unlocked only after inventory completion
- All rooms shown for photo uploads
- Summary page validates all photos before final submission

## Technical Implementation Details

### Room-by-Room Enforcement
**Method:** UI + Controller validation
- UI shows only `$checklist->currentRoom`
- `completeRoom()` validates all tasks checked before allowing progression
- Progress bar shows: `$completedCount / $totalCount`
- Button state: `{{ $completedCount < $totalCount ? 'disabled' : '' }}`

### Inventory Step
**Data Structure:** 12 predefined items created on checklist start
**Validation:** All items must have `is_completed = true` before advancing
**AJAX:** Real-time completion without page reload
**Persistence:** Quantity and availability saved immediately

### Photo Step Enforcement
**Controller Level:**
```php
if ($checklist->workflow_step !== 'photos') {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Photos can only be uploaded after completing tasks and inventory.'
    ], 403);
}
```

**UI Level:** Photo inputs only rendered when workflow_step === 'photos'

### Progress Tracking
**Visual Indicators:**
- Step 1: Blue highlight when active, green when complete
- Step 2: Locked (gray) until step 1 done, blue when active, green when complete
- Step 3: Locked until step 2 done, blue when active

**Timestamps:**
- `tasks_completed_at` - When last room finished
- `inventory_completed_at` - When inventory step finished
- `completed_at` - When entire checklist submitted

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Implementation:
- Fixed set of 12 inventory items (hardcoded in controller)
- Cannot customize inventory per property
- Cannot go back to previous steps (one-way workflow)

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Admin-configurable inventory** - Allow admin to define inventory items per property type
2. **Save & resume** - Allow housekeeper to pause and come back later
3. **Step back button** - Allow returning to previous step to make changes
4. **Property-specific inventory** - Different items for different property types

---

## Performance Considerations

- Page reloads after task/inventory completion to show updated progress
- AJAX used for individual item updates (no full page reload needed)
- Images processed server-side with Intervention Image (timestamp overlay)
- Progress calculations done in blade template (minimal DB queries)

---

## Security Considerations

- All routes protected by `auth` and `role:housekeeper` middleware
- Authorization policy checks: `$this->authorize('update', $checklist)`
- CSRF tokens on all forms
- File upload validation: image type, 10MB max size
- GPS coordinates validated as numeric
- Inventory quantity validated: integer, min:0

---
