# Housekeeper Task Display Fix

## Issue Identified
When a housekeeper started a checklist, they were seeing ALL default tasks for each room instead of only the specific tasks assigned to that room by the owner.

## Root Cause
The `createChecklistItems()` method in `ChecklistController` was fetching all default tasks and applying them to every room, ignoring the room-specific task assignments configured by the property owner.

**Previous Logic:**
```php
private function createChecklistItems(Checklist $checklist)
{
    $tasks = Task::where('is_default', true)->get();
    
    foreach ($checklist->property->rooms as $room) {
        foreach ($tasks as $task) {
            // Created ALL default tasks for EVERY room
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Task Creation Logic
Updated `app/Http/Controllers/Housekeeper/ChecklistController.php`:

- Now fetches tasks specifically assigned to each room via the `room_task` pivot table
- Falls back to default tasks only if no specific tasks are assigned to a room
- Respects the owner's task assignments made through the property/room management interface

**New Logic:**
```php
private function createChecklistItems(Checklist $checklist)
{
    foreach ($checklist->property->rooms as $room) {
        // Get tasks specifically assigned to this room
        $roomTasks = $room->tasks;
        
        // If no specific tasks assigned, fall back to default tasks
        if ($roomTasks->isEmpty()) {
            $roomTasks = Task::where('is_default', true)->get();
        }
        
        foreach ($roomTasks as $task) {
            // Create only assigned tasks
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Checkbox UI
Updated `resources/views/housekeeper/checklist/show.blade.php`:

**Visual Improvements:**
- Increased checkbox size from default to **1.5rem × 1.5rem** (50% larger)
- Made checkboxes more clickable and touch-friendly
- Added hover effect on task rows (light gray background)
- Better spacing between tasks (mb-3 instead of mb-2)
- Made task names bold for better readability
- Added proper alignment between checkbox and label
- Smooth transitions for better UX

**CSS Added:**
```css
.task-checkbox {
    width: 1.5rem !important;
    height: 1.5rem !important;
    cursor: pointer;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}

.form-check {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    padding: 12px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    transition: background-color 0.2s;
}

.form-check:hover {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
}

.form-check-label {
    margin-left: 12px;
    cursor: pointer;
    flex: 1;
    line-height: 1.5rem;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Correct Task Display**: Housekeepers now see only the tasks assigned by the owner for each specific room
2. **Better UX**: Larger, more accessible checkboxes make it easier to mark tasks complete (especially on mobile)
3. **Flexibility**: Falls back to default tasks if owner hasn't customized room tasks yet
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Bold task names and better spacing improve readability
5. **Touch-Friendly**: Larger clickable areas and hover states improve mobile experience

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a property with rooms
- [ ] Assign 2-3 specific tasks to a room (not all default tasks)
- [ ] Create a checklist for that property
- [ ] Start the checklist as a housekeeper
- [ ] Verify only assigned tasks appear (not all default tasks)
- [ ] Check that checkboxes are larger and easier to click
- [ ] Verify hover effects work on task rows
- [ ] Test on mobile device for touch-friendliness
- [ ] Verify task completion still updates progress correctly

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/Housekeeper/ChecklistController.php`
   - Updated `createChecklistItems()` method to use room-specific tasks

2. `resources/views/housekeeper/checklist/show.blade.php`
   - Added custom CSS for larger checkboxes
   - Enhanced form-check styling with hover effects
   - Improved task label formatting

## Database Schema Reference

**Relationships Used:**
- `rooms` table → `room_task` pivot table → `tasks` table
- Room model: `public function tasks()` returns `belongsToMany(Task::class, 'room_task')`

**Migration Status:**
All existing migrations intact. No new migrations required.
