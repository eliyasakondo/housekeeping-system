## 🐛 Bug Fixed: Settings Not Persisting

### **Problem:**
- Settings showed "saved successfully" message
- After page refresh, old values returned
- Changes were not persisting

### **Root Cause:**
Settings were being saved to `storage/app/settings.json` but the controller was not reading from that file on page load. It was always showing defaults from config.

### **Solution:**
Added `getSavedSettings()` method to read from JSON file and use those values when displaying the settings page.

**Code Changes:**
```php
// Before (WRONG)
public function index()
{
    $settings = [
        'app_name' => config('app.name', 'Housekeeping Manager'),
        'primary_color' => '#667eea',  // Always defaults
        'secondary_color' => '#764ba2', // Always defaults
    ];
}

// After (CORRECT)
public function index()
{
    $savedSettings = $this->getSavedSettings(); // Read from JSON
    
    $settings = [
        'app_name' => $savedSettings['app_name'] ?? config('app.name'),
        'primary_color' => $savedSettings['primary_color'] ?? '#667eea',
        'secondary_color' => $savedSettings['secondary_color'] ?? '#764ba2',
    ];
}
```
