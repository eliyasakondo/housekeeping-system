Ensures housekeeper is physically at the property before starting work.

**How It Works:**
```
1. Housekeeper clicks "Start Checklist"
2. Browser requests location permission
3. System gets GPS coordinates
4. Calculates distance to property
5. Within 100 meters? ✓ Allow
6. Too far away? ✗ Block with error message
```

**What's Recorded:**
- Latitude & Longitude
- Verification timestamp
- Distance from property
- Pass/Fail status

---

## 📸 PHOTO DOCUMENTATION

**Every Room Requires:**
- Minimum 8 photos
- Timestamp on each photo
- GPS coordinates recorded
- Organized by room

**Photo Display:**
```
BEDROOM PHOTOS (8)
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Photo 1│ Photo 2│ Photo 3│ Photo 4│

│ Photo 5│ Photo 6│ Photo 7│ Photo 8│
│ 9:19 AM│ 9:20 AM│ 9:21 AM│ 9:22 AM│
