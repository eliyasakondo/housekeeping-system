## Overview
Added complete property management for admins to view, create, edit, and manage all properties across the entire system with owner assignment capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

**Full CRUD Operations:**
- ✅ **index()** - List all properties with filters and search
- ✅ **create()** - Show form to create new property
- ✅ **store()** - Save new property with validation
- ✅ **show()** - View detailed property information
