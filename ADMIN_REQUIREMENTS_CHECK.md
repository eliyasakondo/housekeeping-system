## ❌ **MISSING** - Not Yet Implemented:

### 🚨 **Admin Cannot Manage Properties**

**Issue:** According to requirements:
> "Admin: Full system access and management of users, roles, properties, rooms, assign default rooms, and tasks."

**Current Status:**
- ❌ Admin has NO property management interface
- ❌ No `/admin/properties` route
- ❌ No "Properties" menu item in admin sidebar
- ✅ Owner has property management
- ✅ Properties exist in database

**What's Missing:**
1. Admin cannot create properties
2. Admin cannot edit any property (even if created by owners)
3. Admin cannot delete properties
4. Admin cannot view list of all properties in system
5. Admin cannot see which owner owns which property

**Required Implementation:**
- Create `Admin/PropertyController` with CRUD operations
- Add routes: `/admin/properties` (index, create, store, edit, update, destroy)
- Create views:
  - `admin/properties/index.blade.php` - List all properties with owner info
  - `admin/properties/create.blade.php` - Create new property
  - `admin/properties/edit.blade.php` - Edit existing property
  - `admin/properties/show.blade.php` - View property details
- Add "Properties" menu item to admin sidebar
- Show property owner information in admin views

---

## 📋 Summary

### What Admin Panel HAS:
✅ Dashboard with stats  
✅ User management (full CRUD)  
✅ Task management (full CRUD + defaults)  
✅ Room management (full CRUD + defaults + assign defaults)  
✅ Checklist viewing (filter, search, view details, photos)  
✅ Calendar (view, assign, color-coded)  

### What Admin Panel is MISSING:
❌ **Property Management** (critical requirement)

---

## 🔧 Required Fix

**Action Needed:** Add Property Management to Admin Panel

**Priority:** HIGH - This is explicitly required in the customer requirements

**Files to Create/Modify:**
1. Create `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PropertyController.php`
2. Add routes in `routes/web.php`
3. Create views:
   - `resources/views/admin/properties/index.blade.php`
   - `resources/views/admin/properties/create.blade.php`
   - `resources/views/admin/properties/edit.blade.php`
   - `resources/views/admin/properties/show.blade.php`
4. Update `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` (add sidebar link)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Admin property management should show which OWNER owns each property
- Admin should be able to see ALL properties (not just their own like owners)
- Admin should be able to assign properties to different owners
- Admin should see property statistics (room count, checklist count, etc.)

---

## Recommendation

**Implement Admin Property Management NOW before considering the project complete.**

This is a core requirement from the customer specifications and without it, the admin panel is incomplete according to the contest requirements.
